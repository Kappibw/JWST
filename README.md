# James Webb Space Telescope For Those Of Us That Aren't Astrophysicists But Care A Lot
Layperson's tutorials for working with data from the James Webb Space Telescope

Like many people, I am incredibly excited about the James Webb Space Telescope, and particularly the implications its discoveries may have for the field of Astrobiology. I'm so excited that I want to get involved and "help", but am facing a snag in that I'm not an astrophysicist, nor do I have an education in astronomy. I am a programmer though, and so I'm able to use many of the tools that Astronomers use to interact with the data from James Webb. 

I'm figuring it out as I go along, and taking notes in the form of ipython notebooks, stored here, and hope they might be helpful for others with a similar background to me. Happy exoplaneting!

These tutorials do not require you to be an expert programmer- a basic knowledge of Python should be enough.

## Tutorials

1. [__Accessing JWST Data__](https://github.com/Kappibw/JWST/blob/main/1_accessing_jwst_data.ipynb)

    This tutorial covers finding, programmatically downloading, and viewing real image data from the telescope.
  
2. __Primer on Exoplanets and JWST__

    This is a 2 part tutorial, where the goal is to first get and understand some real JWST exoplanet spectra, and then go through the process of modeling a synthetic exoplanet to match the observed data- thereby telling us what molecules are present in the planet's atmosphere.
    
    Part 1: [Retrieving JWST Exoplanet Spectra](https://github.com/Kappibw/JWST/blob/main/2_retrieving_jwst_spectra.ipynb)
    
    Part 2: (coming soon) Modeling Exoplanet Spectra
