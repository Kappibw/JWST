# James Webb Space Telescope For Those Of Us That Aren't Astrophysicists But Care A Lot
Laypersons tutorials for working with data from the James Webb Space Telescope

Like many people, I'm incredibly excited about the James Webb Space Telescope, and particularly the implications its discoveries may have for the field of Astrobiology. I'm so excited that I want to get involved and "help", but am facing a snag in that I'm not an astrophysicist, nor do I have an education in astronomy. I am a programmer though, and so I'm able to use many of the tools that Astronomers use to interact with the data from James Webb. 

I'm figuring it out as I go along, and taking notes in the form of ipython notebooks, stored here, and hope they might be helpful for others with a similar background to me. Happy exoplaneting!

These tutorials don't require you to be an expert programmer- a basic knowledge of Python should be enough.

## Tutorials

1. __Accessing JWST Data__

    This tutorial covers finding, programmatically downloading, and viewing real data from the telescope.
  
2. __Analysing Exoplanet JWST Data__

    Coming soon (I'm working on it now), this tutorial covers retrieving exoplanet atmosphere spectra from JWST - specifically from WASP-96b, the exoplanet from the [first images](https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-reveals-steamy-atmosphere-of-distant-planet-in-detail) released by NASA. The tutorial then takes you through the process of analysing the planet by modeling your own exoplanet atmosphere to compare it to using exoplanet modeling software [PICASO](https://natashabatalha.github.io/picaso/).
