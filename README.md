Laypersons tutorials for the James Webb Space Telescope

Like many people, I'm incredibly excited about the James Webb Space Telescope, and particularly the implications its discoveries may have for the field of Astrobiology. I'm so excited that I want to get involved and "help", but am facing a snag in that I'm not an astrophysicist, nor do I have an education in astronomy. I am a programmer though, and so I'm able to use many of the tools that Astronomers use to interact with the data from James Webb.

I'm figuring it out as I go along, and taking notes in the form of ipython notebooks, stored here, and hope they might be helpful for others with a similar background to me. Happy exoplaneting!
